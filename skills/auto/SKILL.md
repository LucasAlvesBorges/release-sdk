description: >
  Freeform-intent router for release-sdk. Reads the user's prompt + `.release-planning/`
  state and dispatches to the right `/release:*` skill (or proposes inline execution for
  trivial work). Always prints the chosen route + a 1-line reason before invoking, so the
  user can abort. Falls back to `AskUserQuestion` when classification confidence is low.
  Use when: the user describes an intent without specifying a command, or invokes
  `/release:auto <freeform prompt>`.

## Agent Policy (LOCKED — applies to all routed skills)

NEVER spawn `gsd-*` agents — only `release-*`. Orphan `gsd-*` may appear in `subagent_type` list from prior installs or imported projects; ignore them. This applies to every skill this router dispatches to.

**Substitution map** (`gsd-<x>` → `release-<x>`):
- `gsd-debugger` → `release-debugger`
- `gsd-planner` → `release-planner`
- `gsd-executor` → `release-executor`
- `gsd-code-reviewer` → `release-code-reviewer`
- `gsd-verifier` → `release-verifier`
- `gsd-phase-researcher` → `release-phase-researcher`
- `gsd-pattern-mapper` → `release-pattern-mapper`
- `gsd-plan-checker` → `release-plan-checker`
- `gsd-ui-researcher` → `react-ui-researcher`
- `gsd-ui-checker` → `react-ui-checker`
- `gsd-ui-auditor` → `react-ui-auditor`
- `gsd-code-fixer` → `release-code-fixer`
- `gsd-security-auditor` → `release-security-auditor`
- `gsd-doc-writer` → `release-doc-writer`
- `gsd-roadmapper` → `release-roadmapper`
- `gsd-debug-session-manager` → `release-debug-session-manager`
- (general rule) `gsd-<name>` → `release-<name>`

Substituting `gsd-*` bypasses release-sdk hooks/audit/stack-dispatch and corrupts plugin isolation. If the matching `release-*` agent is missing, abort and surface the gap — do **not** fall back.

# /release:auto — Intent Router

One entry point. User describes what they want; this skill picks the right
`/release:*` command, shows reasoning, dispatches.

## Usage

```
/release:auto fix the bug where invoice export crashes on PDFs >10MB
/release:auto add a new endpoint to list archived projects
/release:auto where am I
/release:auto tela de configurações de empresa
/release:auto import this GSD repo
```

The arg is freeform — no syntax, no flags. Empty arg = same as `/release:status`.

---

## Execution flow

### Step 1 — State scan (always, parallel)

Run these reads in parallel (Bash + Read). Skip gracefully if a path is missing:

| Probe | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `test -d .release-planning && ls .release-planning/` | release-sdk initialized? |
| `test -d .planning && ls .planning/` | GSD source present? (import signal) |
| Read `.release-planning/STATE.md` (first 60 lines) | active phase, stage, cursor |
| `git status --short \| head -20` | uncommitted work? |
| `git log --oneline -3` | recent activity |

Record:
- `release_initialized` (bool)
- `gsd_present` (bool)
- `active_phase` (NN or null)
- `active_stage` (string or null) — one of: `spec`, `discussed`, `planned`, `executing`, `verified`, `shipped`
- `dirty_worktree` (bool)

### Step 2 — Classify intent

Apply rules in order. First match wins. Cite the rule that fired in the dispatch line.

| # | Signal in prompt | State condition | Route |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "import GSD", "port .planning", "switch from GSD" | `gsd_present == true` AND `release_initialized == false` | `/release:import` |
| 2 | empty arg OR "where am I", "status", "what's next", "onde estou", "próximo" | — | `/release:status` |
| 3 | "new project", "bootstrap", "init", "comecei do zero" | `release_initialized == false` | `/release:init` |
| 4 | "ship", "merge", "PR", "publica", "abre PR" | `active_stage == verified` | `/release:ship` |
| 5 | "bug", "broken", "fails", "investigate", "stack trace", "crash", "quebra", "falha", contains pasted error/traceback | — | `/release:debug` |
| 6 | "tela", "screen", "modal", "página", "component", "UI design" | — | `/release:ui-phase` |
| 7 | "LLM", "GPT", "prompt", "embedding", "Claude", "Anthropic", "OpenAI", "RAG" | — | `/release:ai-phase` |
| 8 | "security", "vulnerab", "audit", "OWASP", "auth bypass", "threat" | `active_stage in {executing, verified, shipped}` | `/release:secure-phase` |
| 9 | "security", "vulnerab" — without a shipped/verified phase | — | `/release:security` |
| 10 | "review", "code review", "diff review" | `active_stage in {executing, verified}` | `/release:review` |
| 11 | "test gap", "missing tests", "UAT failed", "add tests" | `active_phase != null` | `/release:verify` |
| 12 | "verify", "UAT", "did it work", "validar" | `active_phase != null` | `/release:verify-work` |
| 13 | "parallel", "workstream", "branch off" | — | `/release:workstreams` |
| 14 | "checklist", "RC1", "RC7", "Q1", "Q7" | — | `/release:checklist` |
| 15 | "execute", "run plan", "roda fase", "termina" | `active_stage == planned` | `/release:execute` |
| 16 | "plan", "break into tasks", "task list", "RC1-RC7" | `active_stage == discussed` | `/release:plan` |
| 17 | "discuss", "explore tradeoffs", "open questions" | `active_stage == spec` | `/release:discuss` |
| 18 | "new feature", "design", "spec", "como modelar", "what should X do" | — | `/release:spec` |
| 19 | bounded multi-file change (3-10 files, no new design): "add field X to model + migration + serializer", "swap library X for Y in {dirs}", "wire CSRF passthrough" | — | `/release:quick` |
| 20 | trivial single-file edit: "rename X to Y", "add log line", "fix typo", "tweak comment", "change variable", "remove unused import" — single-file feel, <30 LOC | — | `/release:fast` |
| 21 | "run all remaining phases", "executa tudo", "termina o milestone", "walk away and finish" | `active_stage in {verified, shipped}` and ROADMAP has more phases | `/release:autonomous` |
| 22 | "analyze repo", "map codebase", "scan stack", "what's in this repo" | — | `/release:map-codebase` |
| 23 | "add test", "regression test for", "coverage for", "test gap fill" — additive testing on existing code | — | `/release:add-tests` |
| 24 | "nyquist", "coverage audit", "validate coverage", "≥2 tests per req" | `active_phase != null` | `/release:validate-phase` |
| 25 | "peer review plan", "cross-AI plan", "convergence", "have codex/gemini review the plan" | `active_stage == planned` | `/release:plan-review-convergence` |
| 26 | "audit UI", "review UI debt", "UI quality scorecard", "6-pillar UI" | `active_phase != null` AND phase has UI | `/release:ui-review` |
| 27 | "audit eval", "AI eval coverage", "eval-review", "are the rubrics covered" | `active_phase != null` AND phase has AI | `/release:eval-review` |
| 28 | "post-mortem", "what went wrong", "diagnose the failure", "forensics" | something in STATE history shows failure | `/release:forensics` |
| 29 | "burn down debt", "fix all issues", "audit-to-fix loop", "clean up the auditor findings" | `active_stage in {verified, shipped}` | `/release:audit-fix` |
| 30 | "UAT status", "outstanding UATs", "cross-phase UAT", "which UATs still pending" | — | `/release:audit-uat` |
| 31 | "update README", "regenerate docs", "refresh ARCHITECTURE.md", "docs out of date" | — | `/release:docs-update` |
| 32 | "pause", "save state", "context handoff", "stopping for the day", "before /clear", "wrap for now" | — | `/release:pause-work` |
| 33 | "resume", "pick up where I left off", "continue from yesterday", "restore session", session-id pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-HHhMM` | `.release-planning/sessions/` exists with ≥1 dir | `/release:resume-work` |
| 34 | "undo", "rollback", "revert", "desfaz fase", "revert plan", "rollback phase" | `dirty_worktree == false` | `/release:undo` |
| 35 | "MVP", "vertical slice", "thin slice", "user story", "SPIDR", "narrow scope", "smallest viable" | `active_phase != null` AND phase status is `not-started` | `/release:mvp-phase` |
| 36 | "new milestone", "next version", "start v1.1", "start v2.0", "começar próximo release", "kick off milestone" | current milestone has 0 phases in `executing`/`planned` | `/release:new-milestone` |
| 37 | "complete milestone", "close milestone", "finish v1.0", "fechar milestone", "ship milestone" | all phases in current milestone at stage `shipped` | `/release:complete-milestone` |
| 38 | "milestone health", "audit milestone", "milestone status", "REQ coverage", "is the milestone ready" | current milestone has ≥1 phase | `/release:audit-milestone` |
| 39 | anything else | — | `<ambiguous>` (Step 3 fallback) |

### Step 3 — Confidence + fallback

After Step 2 picks a route, score confidence:

- **HIGH**: at least 2 signals from rule body matched (e.g., both keyword AND state condition) → dispatch directly.
- **MED**: single keyword match with no state condition → dispatch but print a softer reason ("matched keyword X; if wrong, abort and re-run with explicit command").
- **LOW** OR route == `<ambiguous>`: do NOT dispatch. Use `AskUserQuestion` with the top 2 candidate routes + an "Other (type command)" escape:

```
Question: "Intent unclear. Which /release:* command?"
Options:
  - "/release:spec — define a new feature"  (description: "...")
  - "/release:status — show current state"  (description: "...")
  - "Other — let me type the command"       (description: "...")
```

User pick → dispatch. "Other" → exit cleanly with the candidate list printed.

### Step 4 — Dispatch protocol

Before invoking the chosen skill, print ONE line:

```
→ /release:auto routing to {chosen_skill} — reason: {rule N, "signal: ...", state: "..."}
```

Then invoke via the `Skill` tool with the chosen skill name and the original freeform arg
as `args`. Do NOT modify the user prompt. Do NOT inject extra context. The downstream skill
reads `.release-planning/STATE.md` on its own.

(Inline execution is no longer a route in this skill — rule 19 dispatches to `/release:quick`
and rule 20 dispatches to `/release:fast`, both of which own their own inline / agent flow.
`/release:auto` itself never does the work directly.)

---

## Constraints

- **One dispatch per invocation.** Never call two `Skill` tools in a row. If the chosen
  skill needs follow-up, the user re-invokes `/release:auto` after it finishes.
- **Never auto-commit on routing.** The chosen skill owns its own commits — including
  `/release:fast` and `/release:quick`. `/release:auto` itself never touches the worktree.
- **Never modify `.release-planning/STATE.md` directly.** State transitions belong to the
  dispatched skill.
- **Never write to `.planning/`.** That's GSD-owned (see `release-import-orchestrator`).
- **Print the route before dispatch.** No silent routing — the user must always see the
  decision and have time to abort.
- **Fall back loudly.** LOW confidence → `AskUserQuestion`, never a silent guess.
- **No infinite loops.** If the chosen skill itself ends up re-invoking `/release:auto`,
  abort with: `"Route loop detected: {chosen_skill} → /release:auto. Exiting."`

---

## Example — HIGH confidence dispatch

```
/release:auto fix the bug where invoice export crashes on PDFs >10MB

→ State: release_initialized=true, active_phase=03-invoice-pdf-export,
         active_stage=executing, dirty_worktree=false
→ Match: rule 5 (signal: "bug" + "crashes")
→ Confidence: HIGH (keyword × 2)
→ /release:auto routing to /release:debug — reason: bug report with crash signal during active phase
[dispatches to /release:debug with the original prompt as args]
```

## Example — MED confidence dispatch

```
/release:auto add archive endpoint

→ State: release_initialized=true, active_phase=null
→ Match: rule 18 (signal: "add" + implicit "new feature")
→ Confidence: MED (single keyword; no active phase context)
→ /release:auto routing to /release:spec — reason: looks like a new feature request;
  if wrong, abort and run /release:auto with a clearer intent
[dispatches to /release:spec]
```

## Example — LOW confidence fallback

```
/release:auto check the celery thing

→ State: release_initialized=true, active_phase=02-celery-tasks, active_stage=executing
→ Match: no clear rule (could be debug, review, verify, secure-phase)
→ Confidence: LOW
→ AskUserQuestion: "Intent unclear. Which /release:* command?"
   Options:
     - "/release:review — code-review the active phase"
     - "/release:verify-work — run UAT against the phase"
     - "Other — let me type the command"
```

## Example — Import detection

```
/release:auto onde estou

→ State: release_initialized=false, gsd_present=true
→ Match: rule 1 (gsd source detected, release-sdk not initialized — bridge needed first)
→ Confidence: HIGH (state-driven)
→ /release:auto routing to /release:import — reason: GSD .planning/ present but
  .release-planning/ missing; run import before any other /release:* command
[dispatches to /release:import]
```

## Example — Trivial single-file edit

```
/release:auto rename `EmpresaSerializer.user_email` to `owner_email`

→ State: release_initialized=true, dirty_worktree=false
→ Match: rule 20 (trivial rename; single-symbol scope)
→ Confidence: HIGH
→ /release:auto routing to /release:fast — reason: single-file rename, < 30 LOC
[dispatches to /release:fast]
```

## Example — Bounded multi-file change

```
/release:auto add `archived_at` to Invoice model + migration + serializer + admin

→ State: release_initialized=true, active_phase=03-invoice-pdf-export, active_stage=executing
→ Match: rule 19 (bounded scope: 4 files, no new design)
→ Confidence: HIGH
→ /release:auto routing to /release:quick — reason: multi-file (4) but bounded; no SPEC needed
[dispatches to /release:quick]
```

## Notes

- This skill is meta: it does NOT itself plan, execute, or modify project state. It only
  routes. All real work happens in the dispatched skill.
- For users who prefer explicit commands: `/release:auto` is opt-in; nothing else in
  release-sdk depends on it.
- GSD analog: this mirrors `gsd-progress` ("unified situational command"). release-sdk
  now ships native equivalents for the high-traffic verbs (`/release:debug`,
  `/release:quick`, `/release:fast`, `/release:ship`, `/release:autonomous`,
  `/release:map-codebase`, `/release:add-tests`, `/release:validate-phase`,
  `/release:plan-review-convergence`, `/release:ui-review`, `/release:eval-review`,
  `/release:forensics`, `/release:audit-fix`, `/release:audit-uat`,
  `/release:docs-update`, `/release:pause-work`, `/release:resume-work`,
  `/release:undo`, `/release:mvp-phase`, `/release:new-milestone`,
  `/release:complete-milestone`, `/release:audit-milestone`) so routing stays inside the `/release:*` namespace.
  `/gsd:*` is no longer a fallback path here.
- Future work: train a tiny embeddings-based classifier from real routing logs to replace
  the heuristic table. For now, the table is good enough and auditable.
